**QuizVerse** is a web platform where any users as teachers can create quizzes and other users as students can take them.  
After completing a quiz, the system automatically grades it and shows the result.  
Quiz creators can view who took their quizzes and their scores, while users can view their own quizzes results.

  is_staff boolean 
}

Table Profile {
  id int [pk]
  user_id int [ref: > User.id]
