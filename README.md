# üß† QuizVerse ‚Äì Online Quiz Creator & Taker Platform

## üí° Concept
**QuizVerse** is a web platform where any user can create quizzes and other users can take them.  
After completing a quiz, the system automatically grades it and shows the result.  
Quiz creators can view who took their quizzes and their scores, while users can view their own quiz history and results.

- As a logged-in user, I can create a new quiz (title + questions + choices).  
- As a user, I can view all available quizzes created by others.  
- As a user, I can take a quiz and see my score at the end.  
- As a quiz creator, I can see all participants and their scores for my quizzes.  
- As a user, I can view my quiz history (quizzes I took and scores).
